# Voice to Motion Agent

Middleware development project demonstrating LLM integration for robotics. The Python-based system uses the Gemini API to parse voice instructions, map them to a defined set of robot primitives (e.g., rotate(angle)). Optimized for execution on a low-power edge device (Raspberry Pi 3A+).
